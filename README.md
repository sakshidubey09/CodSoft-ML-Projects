### Task 3 - Churn Prediction Model

#### Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using a machine learning model, specifically a Logistic Regression classifier. Churn, in the context of this project, refers to the likelihood of customers discontinuing their services or subscriptions. By analyzing historical data and relevant features, the model can identify patterns indicative of potential churn, enabling proactive retention strategies.

#### How to Use

To predict customer churn, input the necessary customer information into the implemented Logistic Regression classifier. The model will generate a prediction, aiding in the identification of customers at risk of discontinuing their services.

#### Key Features

- Logistic Regression Classifier: A machine learning model suitable for binary classification tasks, such as predicting customer churn.
- Feature Engineering: Extraction and transformation of relevant customer-related features to enhance model performance.
- Evaluation Metrics: Utilizes metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for assessing the effectiveness of the churn prediction model.
