# Task 1 - Movie Genre Prediction
Naive Bayes ML model to predict movie genre when given a description

#### Overview
This project employs a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier to predict movie genres based on a dataset containing movie titles, genres, and descriptions. The predictive model is trained using text data preprocessing techniques, including TF-IDF vectorization.

#### How to Use
To predict a movie's genre, provide a description to the implemented classifier. The trained model intelligently assigns genres to movie descriptions, offering a valuable tool for genre prediction in various applications.

#### Key Features

- Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier: Employs a machine learning model specialized in text classification to predict movie genres based on descriptions.
- Text Data Preprocessing: Implements techniques such as TF-IDF vectorization to convert movie descriptions into a format suitable for machine learning.
- Genre Prediction: The model intelligently assigns movie genres using learned patterns from the training data.
- Model Evaluation Metrics: Utilizes metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the performance of the genre prediction model.

# Task 2 - Credit Card Fraud Detection

#### Overview

This project utilizes a Decision Tree classifier to detect credit card fraud based on a dataset containing credit card transactions. The model is trained using supervised learning techniques, and features engineering methods to identify patterns indicative of fraudulent activities.

#### How to Use

To assess the likelihood of fraud in a credit card transaction, input the relevant transaction details into the implemented classifier. The model will provide a prediction, aiding in the early detection of potential fraud.

#### Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [provide_dataset_source_link]. It includes transaction information, such as transaction amount, timestamp, and other relevant features. The target variable indicates whether the transaction is fraudulent or legitimate.

#### Key Features

- Decision Tree Classifier: A machine learning model capable of learning decision rules to classify transactions.
- Feature Engineering: Extraction and transformation of relevant features to enhance model performance.
- Evaluation Metrics: Utilizes metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for assessing model performance.
